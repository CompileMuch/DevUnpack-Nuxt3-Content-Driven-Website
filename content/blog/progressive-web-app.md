# The Power of Progressive Web Apps: Revolutionizing Business with Advanced User Experience and Enhanced Functionality

Progressive Web Apps (PWA) have been gaining popularity among businesses due to their numerous advantages. According to research, PWAs have resulted in a 68% increase in mobile traffic, a 15-fold improvement of load and installation speed, a 25-times reduction in device storage usage, a 52% average conversion increase, a 78% average session increase, a 137% engagement increase, a 42.86% lower bounce rate compared to mobile websites, and a 133.67% increase in page views. These figures reflect the enhanced user experience that PWAs offer, making them a valuable option for businesses, from startups to market leaders.

Here are some of the key advantages of PWAs for businesses:

## Low Development Costs
PWAs do not require separate versions for different devices, as a single progressive app can meet the requirements of all endpoints on which it operates. This significantly reduces the amount of effort that developers provide, resulting in a cost reduction. The cost to create a PWA is three or four times lower than that of a native mobile app.

## App-Like Look and Feel
PWAs provide an advanced user experience by combining the look and feel of mobile applications and the best of website performance. They have a design and settings that are very similar to those of native mobile software. Regardless of technologies, tools, and frameworks on which PWAs are developed, they provide the same user experience as native mobile apps, which is considered superior to that of websites.

## Fast Installation
Unlike regular mobile applications, PWAs do not require a long and complex installation process, which significantly improves user experience. Users can download a PWA quickly and directly to their devices without going to the App Store or Google Play. This streamlines the procedure and significantly reduces user abandonment.

## Better Performance
PWAs cache and serve text, images, and other content in a specific, efficient manner, which enables them to operate like websites and significantly improves the running speed. Along with quick operation, impeccable performance is another attribute that has an impact on user experience and conversion rates.

## Platform- and Device-Agnosticism
PWAs work everywhere and provide a uniform user experience on different endpoints. This type of application enables cross-support to users that switch between their devices by providing them with a continuous experience.

## No Updating Issues
PWAs update automatically, without notifying users and bothering them with permission requests. These apps update themselves every time when users visit them, eliminating the need to download batch changes and install them.

## Seamless Offline Operation
PWAs can operate offline or in compromised networks, allowing users to access information without an internet connection. Built-in service workers cache important progressive web appsâ€™ features and information automatically, eliminating the necessity to download it.

## No Dependence on App Distribution Services
PWAs do not need to be stored in app distribution services, such as the App Store or Google Play, which reduces the complexity of reconciliation procedures.

## Push Notification Functionality
PWAs have access to device-specific functionality, such as push notifications, which can significantly increase opportunities to promote products or services.

## Enhanced Security
PWAs rely on HTTPS to provide data safety and minimize the risk of security issues.

In conclusion, Progressive Web Apps offer a combination of the most efficient capabilities of native mobile software and web applications, which significantly improves user experience and increases retention rates. Enhanced security, low development costs, and platform-agnosticism are the features that make PWAs the go-to choice of multiple market players, such as Twitter, AliExpress, and Forbes.

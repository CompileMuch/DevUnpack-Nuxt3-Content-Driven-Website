Understanding Machine Learning
::

::element-p
Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the development of algorithms and models that enable computers to learn from and make decisions based on data. Unlike traditional programming, where developers write explicit instructions for a computer to follow, machine learning algorithms learn from data, adjusting their parameters to improve their predictions or decisions over time.
::

 
::element-h2
Machine learning can be broadly categorized into three types:
::

::element-p
**Supervised Learning:** In supervised learning, the algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, where the input data is associated with the correct output. The algorithm learns the relationship between the input and output, enabling it to make predictions on new, unseen data.
::

::element-p
**Unsupervised Learning:** Unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data, meaning the algorithm must find patterns or relationships within the data without any guidance. Common unsupervised learning techniques include clustering and dimensionality reduction.
::

::element-p
**Reinforcement Learning:** Reinforcement learning is centered around the concept of an agent learning to make decisions by interacting with an environment. The agent receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties and adjusts its actions to maximize the cumulative reward over time.

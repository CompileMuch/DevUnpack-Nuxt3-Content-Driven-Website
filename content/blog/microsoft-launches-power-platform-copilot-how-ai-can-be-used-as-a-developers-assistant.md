 # Microsoft Launches Power Platform Copilot: How AI Can Be Used as a Developer’s Assistant
 
## How Microsoft’s Power Platform Copilot Uses AI

Microsoft recently unveiled Power Platform Copilot, an AI-powered app builder designed to help developers build more efficiently. The tool works by suggesting code and other resources to the developer as they work. This can save a significant amount of time and effort for developers, allowing them to focus on the more creative aspects of the app-building process.

One of the key benefits of Power Platform Copilot is that it can help developers who are less experienced or who work alone. When using the tool, developers can rely on its AI capability to suggest code or explore designs they may not have thought of themselves, helping them to build a more robust app.

Plus, Microsoft continues to improve the platform with updated knowledge and machine learning algorithms, making Power Platform Copilot a versatile assistant for developers of all levels.

## The Future of AI-Powered App-Building

As AI technology improves, we can only imagine the possibilities for developers. For instance, AI could be used to automatically identify and fix bugs in code or to suggest design improvements based on user feedback. All of these applications of AI could significantly reduce the workload for developers, freeing up time for more innovative work.

However, some people are hesitant about the growing presence of AI in the workplace. There is certainly a concern that AI could eliminate jobs and lead to more widespread automation in various industries. However, companies like Microsoft aim to reassure people that AI technology isn't here to replace humans, but rather to assist them.

Overall, the integration of AI in app-building tools like Power Platform Copilot shows immense potential for the future of software development. It could revolutionize the way we approach app-building, making it more accessible and efficient for developers of all skill levels. The possibilities are endless.

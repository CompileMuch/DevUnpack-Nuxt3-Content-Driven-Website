## Release Date Rumors
Fans may be in for a pleasant surprise with the latest rumors suggesting that GTA 6 could hit the shelves as early as 2024. According to a post from reputed GTA leaker @TezFunz2, the "aimed-always-changing-not-set-in-stone deadline is holiday 2024." This aligns with previous rumors about a 2024 release, as Microsoft mentioned in a response to the UK's CMA back in November 2022 that the GTA 6 release date "is expected" in 2024.

However, Rockstar Games has yet to officially confirm the release date for GTA 6. Their most recent statement came in a February 2022 tweet announcing that "active development for the next entry in the series is underway."

This statement followed a major data breach in which hackers leaked Grand Theft Auto VI content, marking one of the largest confidential data breaches in gaming history. The leak included development footage, source code, and more than 90 videos and images of the highly anticipated follow-up game. Rockstar Games expressed extreme disappointment over the incident.

In response to the leak, Rockstar Games confirmed that an unauthorized third party had illegally accessed and downloaded confidential information from its systems, including GTA footage. The company assured fans that they would "properly" introduce them to GTA 6 when it is ready.


While the leaked information and rumors surrounding GTA 6 must be taken with a grain of salt until Rockstar Games provides an official confirmation, it's difficult not to get excited about the potential locations, events, and the possible release date of the next installment in the series. Whether it's returning to Vice City, taking part in a thrilling casino heist, or experiencing new gameplay elements, we're confident that GTA 6 won't disappoint. Keep your eyes peeled for more news and updates on GTA 6 as they become available!

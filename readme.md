Notes:

-   Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of your GitHub repository.
-   If you have a screenshot of the project structure, replace `<screenshot-url-here>` with the actual URL to the screenshot.
-   You might also want to add a `LICENSE` file to your repository if you haven't already, especially if you mention it in the README.
-   This README assumes you have a `.env.example` file as a template for `.env`. If not, consider adding one as it's a best practice for projects that use environment variables.
-   Tailor the Contributing section based on whether you have specific guidelines for contributors.
-   Adjust the Deployment section according to your actual deployment process, especially if it's not AWS-specific or if you use a different service.
